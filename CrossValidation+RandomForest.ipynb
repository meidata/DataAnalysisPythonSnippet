    "### Parameter Tuning\n",
    "The first, and easiest, thing we can do to improve the accuracy of the random forest is to increase the number of trees we're using. Training more trees will take more time, but because of the fact that we're averaging many predictions made on different subsets of the data, having more trees will increase accuracy greatly (up to a point).\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also tweak the min_samples_split and min_samples_leaf variables to reduce overfitting. Because of how a decision tree works, having splits that go all the way down, or overly deep in the tree can result in fitting to quirks in the dataset, and not true signal. Thus, increasing min_samples_split and min_samples_leaf can reduce overfitting, which will actually improve our score, as we're making predictions on unseen data. A model that is less overfit, and that can generalize better, will actually perform better on unseen data, but worse on seen data."

    "### Gradient Boosting\n",
    "Another method that builds on decision trees is a *gradient boosting classifier*. Boosting involves training decision trees one after another, and feeding the errors from one tree into the next tree. So each tree is building on all the other trees that came before it. This can lead to overfitting if we build too many trees, though. As you get above 100 trees or so, it's very easy to overfit and train to quirks in the dataset. As our dataset is extremely small, we'll limit the tree count to just 25.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to limit overfitting is to limit the depth to which each tree in the gradient boosting process can be built. We'll limit the tree depth to 3 to avoid overfitting.\n",

    "### Ensembling\n",
    "One thing we can do to improve the accuracy of our predictions is to ensemble different classifiers. Ensembling means that we generate predictions using information from a set of classifiers, instead of just one. In practice, this means that we average their predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, the more diverse the models we ensemble, the higher our accuracy will be. Diversity means that the models generate their results from different columns, or use a very different method to generate predictions. Ensembling a random forest classifier with a decision tree probably won't work extremely well, because they are very similar. On the other hand, ensembling a linear regression with a random forest can work very well.\n",
    "\n",
    "One caveat with ensembling is that the classifiers we use have to be about the same in terms of accuracy. Ensembling one classifier that is much worse than another probably will make the final result worse.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, we'll ensemble logistic regression trained on the most linear predictors (the ones that have a linear ordering, and some correlation to Survived), and a gradient boosted tree trained on all of the predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll keep things simple when we ensemble -- we'll average the raw probabilities (from 0 to 1) that we get from our classifiers, and then assume that anything above .5 maps to one, and anything below or equal to .5 maps to 0."
